Integrates Qody's Facebook metatag control into your site, giving you complete control over how your posts display when shared.

== Description ==

Specifically, the FB Meta plugin allows you to customize every possible Facebook open 
graph field used when sharing content across the Facebook network, giving you the 
ultimate flexibility and efficiency to choose how you want posts displayed.

To make things even easier, the plugin allows defaults to be set which are used for 
any page / post that doesn't have more specific settings. This means you can set your 
logo as the default share image if a post doesn't have any set, or your site's main 
tagline if a post is missing it's description excerpt.
